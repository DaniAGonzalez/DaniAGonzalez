I am a professional with experience in Biological Sciences and Biotechnology (PhD and BS), currently pursuing a Master's in Data Science at Northeastern University in Boston, Massachusetts.

Throughout my career, I have led teams focused on multivariate data analysis and optimizations, providing training and guidance to fellow students and researchers. 

My research initiatives have aimed at valorizing regional natural resources, conducting lab tasks for various projects. Additionally, I have evaluated chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic properties of bioactive compounds using cancer cell culture lines and several model organisms.
I have received various scholarships and awards recognizing my work in the field as well as my professional trajectory.

My skills include advanced research, communication, and teamwork abilities, along with expertise in laboratory techniques (wet and dry techniques), data analysis (EDA, data viz, modeling), and programming in Python and R.
